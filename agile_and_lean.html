          <h2>Basic description of Agile Project Management</h2>

          <h3>Agile project management definition  </h3>
          <p>Agile project management is a methodology used primarily in software development that favors flexibility and collaboration, incorporating customer feedback throughout the project life cycle. The methodology takes an iterative approach to development, breaking down work into small, manageable cycles called “sprints” to focus on continuous improvement in the development of a product or service.  </p>
          <p>In addition to emphasizing iterative development, in which each sprint results in a potentially shippable increment, agile project management incorporates cross-functional teams who work closely with stakeholders in a process that allows for adjustments as requirements evolve and formalizes feedback loops at the end of each sprint.  </p>
          
          <h3>Agile Project Management benefits</h3>
          <p>Compared to traditional project management, agile provides project teams, sponsors, project leaders, and customers many project-specific benefits, including:  </p>

          <ul>
            <li>More rapid deployment of solutions </li>
            <li>Reduced waste through minimization of resources  </li>

          <h2>Basic description of Lean Project Management</h2>
          <h3>What Is Lean Project Management?  </h3>
          <p>Lean project management is the application of lean manufacturing principles to the practice of project management. The goal of lean project management is to maximize value while minimizing waste. Lean manufacturing principles were developed by Toyota in the 1950s and applied in the 1970s to combat the energy crisis. The term “lean” was coined in the late 1980s. The Project Management Institute sums it up: “To be Lean is to provide what is needed, when it is needed, with the minimum amount of materials, equipment, labor, and space.”  </p>

          <p>Lean manufacturing identifies three types of waste: muda, muri, and mura (known collectively as the 3M).  </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Muda refers to activities that consume resources without providing additional value  </li>
            <li>Muri refers to the overuse of equipment or employees  </li>
            <li>Mura is operational “unevenness,” which decreases efficiency and productivity in the long term  </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Lean Project Management aims to reduce the 3M within the project process.  </p>

          <h3>What are the benefits of Lean Project Management?  </h3>
          <p>Organizations that use lean project management can expect:  Organizations that use lean project management can expect:  </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduced lead times  </li>
            <li>Lower inventory and storage costs</li>
            <li>Decreased overall costs  </li>
            <li>Improved productivity and efficiency  </li>
            <li>Greater quality  </li>
            <li>Higher customer satisfaction  </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>The five key principles of Lean Project Management  </h3>
          <p>First published in 1996, the book Lean Thinking by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones introduced five key principles that can be used to apply the lean concept to project management.  </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Specify value: What is the project’s value in the mind of the customer? </li>
            <li>Map the value stream: A “value stream” map shows the entire process for creating the product or project. Once this process is mapped, it can be analyzed for waste, such as unnecessary steps that tax resources or compromise quality.  </li>
            <li>Make value flow by eliminating waste: Creating an improvement plan will eliminate the waste identified in the value stream. This plan represents a “future state” for the project’s process.  </li>
            <li>Make value flow at the customer’s demand: The ideal scenario is to move the project forward or create the product when requested by the customer. Get as close to this as possible to reduce inventory and save resources.  </li>
            <li>Embrace continuous improvement in pursuit of perfection: Regularly reassess the project process to eliminate waste and maximizing productivity and efficiency.  </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Differences between Waterfall and Agile Project Management </h2>
          <img src="src/images/difference-agile-lean.png" alt="The Scrum Framework" />
          <h3>Waterfall Project Management </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Waterfall projects follow a linear and sequential approach, where each phase of the project must be completed before the next one begins. Common phases include requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. </li>
            <li>Waterfall requires extensive project planning, scope definition, and documentation at the beginning of the project. Changes to scope and requirements are difficult to implement once the project starts. </li>
            <li>Documentation is a critical component of the Waterfall methodology. Detailed documentation for each phase serves as a reference through the project lifecycle. </li>
            <li>The scope, timeline, and costs are determined at the start of the project, making it suitable for projects with well-understood requirements. </li>
            <li>Due to its linear nature, any changes or errors discovered late in the project can be costly and difficult to rectify. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Due to its linear nature, any changes or errors discovered late in the project can be costly and difficult to rectify. </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Agile projects are broken down into small, manageable increments or iterations, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. This allows for regular feedback and adjustments throughout the project. </li>
            <li>While there is an overall plan, Agile projects are flexible and expect changes in requirements and scope. Agile embraces change, even late in development, to ensure the product meets the end users' needs. </li>
            <li>Agile focuses on regular communication and close collaboration between cross-functional teams and stakeholders. Daily stand-ups and retrospectives are common practices. </li>
            <li>Agile methods prioritize customer feedback and satisfaction. Working products or prototypes are delivered frequently to get feedback and ensure the product aligns with customer needs. </li>
            <li>Regular iterations and feedback loops allow for early detection of issues and course corrections, reducing overall project risk. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Key Differences Summarized </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Approach: Waterfall is linear and sequential; Agile is iterative and incremental. </li>
            <li>Flexibility: Waterfall has limited flexibility once the project starts; Agile accommodates and encourages changes. </li>
            <li>Planning: Waterfall requires detailed upfront planning; Agile plans are more flexible and evolve as the project progresses. </li>
            <li>Documentation: Waterfall relies heavily on documentation; Agile focuses more on collaboration and working software. </li>
            <li>Risk Management: Waterfall risks are generally addressed at the end; Agile addresses risks continuously throughout the project. </li>
          </ul>
          <img src="src/images/fight-agile-lean.png" alt="The Scrum Framework" />

          <h3>Typical Use Cases: </h3>
          <h4>Use Cases for Waterfall Project Management </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Construction Projects: Building a house or commercial property requires a sequential approach, from foundation laying to framing, plumbing, and finishing.  </li>
            <li>Manufacturing: When producing physical goods, such as cars or appliances, the production process is linear, and changes in later stages can lead to significant rework and expenses. </li>
            <li>Regulated Projects: Projects in industries like aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and finance often have strict regulatory requirements. The comprehensive documentation and predefined scope of Waterfall can be necessary to ensure compliance. </li>
            <li>Well-Defined Projects: Projects with clear, stable requirements and no expected changes in scope can benefit from Waterfall's structured approach. An example could be the development of a standard software application with well-understood requirements. </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Use Cases for Agile Project Management </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Software Development: Agile is particularly well-suited for software projects, where requirements can change rapidly due to technology advancements or user feedback. Agile's iterative nature allows for continuous improvement and adaptation. </li>
            <li>Product Development in Fast-Moving Industries: In sectors like technology or consumer electronics, where market demands and trends can shift quickly, Agile allows teams to adapt product features based on real-time customer feedback. </li>
            <li>Projects with Uncertain Requirements: When the final product cannot be fully defined at the outset, Agile allows for exploration and adjustments as more information becomes available. This is common in new product innovations. </li>
            <li>Highly Collaborative Projects: Projects that benefit from close teamwork, ongoing stakeholder engagement, and frequent communication are well-suited to Agile. Examples include creative and marketing campaigns where client input is crucial throughout the project. </li>
            <li>Rapid Prototyping: When a project involves creating prototypes to test concepts or designs, Agile's iterative cycles are ideal for refining the product based on continuous testing and feedback </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Disadvantages of Agile and Lean Project Managment styles. </h2>
          <h3>Disadvantages of Agile</h3>
          <p>The Agile methodology is very popular in project teams across the globe, particularly in software development. This is because there are myriad benefits to incorporating Agile practices into your organization, including customer satisfaction, higher-quality deliverables, improved communication, and fewer risks.  </p>
          <p>However, some teams have also encountered problems with Agile. These Agile drawbacks can derail a project and threaten its success, so it’s important to recognize and tackle them before they escalate.   </p>
          <p>Let’s take a closer look at the disadvantages of Agile:   </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Lack of documentation  
              <p>This is one of the biggest issues faced when teams transition from Waterfall project management to an Agile framework. Agile teams condense large volumes of data into smaller user stories, which don’t contain a great amount of detail. This can make it difficult for a developer to grasp the exact customer requirements. Without a clearly documented plan or an official process to follow, team members can easily get confused when moving through project stages.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Scope creep
              <p>Another major obstacle is scope creep. Customer needs change constantly, inevitably leading to a widening of the project scope. Deliverables multiply quickly, and new features are often added to the workload. Some requirements may need to be rewritten entirely or replaced with updated ones. Teams can become overwhelmed and lose track of these requirements, unsure of which ones to prioritize.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              High demands on time  
              <p>Time is another consideration to add to the list of Agile challenges. Team members must make room in their schedule for daily standup meetings, which can disrupt their workflow. What’s more, the Agile philosophy requires developers to engage in constant collaboration with testers, clients, and other project stakeholders. This high level of interaction can place a significant strain on Agile team members and their time management abilities.  </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Unsuitable for long-term projects
              <p>Finally, one of the most common Agile problems occurs when teams try to make the methodology work for unsuitable projects. Agile iterations are designed to produce smaller deliverables incrementally, which is ideal for software development. However, this level of fragmentation would not be compatible with a long-term project. For example, in a construction project such as building a house, the final deliverable is fixed and change is undesirable, making it more suited to a Waterfall framework.  </p>
              <p>To limit the potential disadvantages of Agile, you should research your preferred Agile project management framework thoroughly before implementing it in your organization. If you already use an Agile framework, consider the question posed by professional services firm Deloitte: “How fragile is your Agile?” Document your existing pain points and brainstorm ways to strengthen your future Agile projects.  </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
