            <h2>Four main components of a quality management system </h2>
            <p>A Quality Management System (QMS) consists of several interrelated components that work together to ensure that an organization consistently meets customer and regulatory requirements while striving for continuous improvement. The four main components of a QMS are </p>

            <ol>

                <li>
                    Quality Policy and Objectives: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The quality policy is a formal statement from management that outlines the organization's commitment to quality. </li>
                        <li>Quality objectives are specific, measurable goals derived from the quality policy that align with the organization's strategic direction. </li>
                        <li>These components provide a framework for establishing and communicating the organization's quality priorities and expectations. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Quality Planning: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quality planning involves identifying quality requirements and standards relevant to the organization's products, services, and processes. </li>
                        <li>It includes defining quality objectives, establishing processes and procedures to meet those objectives, and allocating resources accordingly. </li>
                        <li>Quality planning ensures that the organization's activities are aligned with its quality policy and objectives. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Quality Control: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quality control focuses on monitoring and verifying that products, services, and processes meet specified requirements and standards. </li>
                        <li>It involves activities such as inspections, testing, and measurements to identify defects or deviations from quality standards. </li>
                        <li>Quality control aims to prevent defects or errors from reaching customers and to ensure that products and services meet quality expectations. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Quality Improvement: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Quality improvement is the ongoing effort to enhance products, services, and processes to achieve better performance and outcomes. </li>
                        <li>It involves analyzing data, identifying areas for improvement, implementing corrective and preventive actions, and evaluating the effectiveness of those actions. </li>
                        <li>Continuous improvement is a core principle of a QMS, driven by feedback from customers, stakeholders, and internal processes. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <p>
                    These four components work together in a QMS to create a systematic approach to managing quality throughout an organization. By implementing and maintaining a QMS, organizations can achieve greater consistency, efficiency, and customer satisfaction while continuously striving for excellence.
