            <h2>Risk management process</h2>
            <p>
                Risk management is a crucial aspect of any organization or project, aiming to identify, assess, and mitigate potential risks that could negatively impact objectives. The risk management process typically involves several key steps: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Identification of Risks: This step involves systematically identifying potential risks that could affect the project or organization. Risks can come from various sources including internal factors such as personnel issues or external factors like market fluctuations or regulatory changes. </li>
                <li>Risk Assessment: Once risks are identified, they need to be assessed to determine their potential impact and likelihood of occurring. This step often involves qualitative and/or quantitative analysis to prioritize risks based on their severity and probability. </li>
                <li>Risk Analysis: This step involves analyzing the identified risks in more detail to understand their root causes, potential consequences, and possible triggers. Various techniques such as risk mapping, scenario analysis, or cause and effect diagrams can be used in this phase. </li>
                <li>Risk Response Planning: After analyzing the risks, organizations need to develop strategies to respond to them effectively. There are typically four main strategies for addressing risks: avoidance, mitigation, transfer, and acceptance. The chosen response strategy will depend on factors such as the nature of the risk, available resources, and organizational objectives. </li>
                <li>Implementation of Risk Responses: Once risk response plans are developed, they need to be implemented effectively. This may involve changes to processes, allocation of resources, or the purchase of insurance, depending on the chosen response strategy. </li>
                <li>Monitoring and Review: Risk management is an ongoing process, and it's essential to continually monitor and review the effectiveness of risk responses. This involves tracking identified risks, assessing changes in their likelihood or impact, and adjusting risk response plans as necessary. </li>
                <li>Communication and Reporting: Throughout the risk management process, effective communication is essential. Stakeholders need to be kept informed about the identified risks, planned responses, and any changes to the risk landscape. Regular reporting on risk management activities helps ensure transparency and accountability. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>By following a structured risk management process, organizations can proactively identify and address potential threats, minimize their impact, and enhance the likelihood of achieving their objectives. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="chapter">

            <h2>Different Risk Management processes</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Project Risk Management: This process focuses on identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks specific to a particular project. It often follows a structured approach outlined by project management standards such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) or PRINCE2 (Projects in Controlled Environments). </li>
                <li>Enterprise Risk Management (ERM): ERM is a holistic approach to managing risks across an entire organization. It considers risks from all sources and aims to integrate risk management into the organization's strategic decision-making processes. ERM frameworks such as the COSO ERM framework or ISO 31000 provide guidelines for implementing ERM practices. </li>
                <li>Financial Risk Management: This process focuses specifically on managing financial risks such as market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. Financial institutions, corporations, and investment firms often employ financial risk management strategies to protect their assets and optimize their financial performance. </li>
                <li>Information Security Risk Management: In the digital age, information security is a critical concern for organizations. Information security risk management involves identifying and mitigating risks related to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and IT systems. Frameworks like NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO/IEC 27001 provide guidelines for managing information security risks. </li>
                <li>Supply Chain Risk Management: Organizations that rely on complex supply chains face various risks related to logistics, supplier reliability, geopolitical factors, and natural disasters. Supply chain risk management involves identifying vulnerabilities in the supply chain and implementing strategies to mitigate these risks. </li>
                <li>Operational Risk Management: Operational risks arise from internal processes, systems, or people within an organization. Operational risk management involves identifying, assessing, and controlling these risks to minimize disruptions to business operations. It encompasses areas such as process failures, human error, and regulatory compliance. </li>         
            </ul>

            <p>These are just a few examples of specialized risk management processes. Depending on the industry, regulatory requirements, and specific organizational objectives, there may be other tailored approaches to managing risks effectively. </p>

                <h2>Benefits of Risk Management</h2>

                <p>A strong project risk management plan allows managers to look at the entirety of their project from numerous perspectives including:  Resource; Technical; Cost, Schedule; Scope, Process/Procedure; Internal Threats; External Threats to name a few.  Through a lens of what could go wrong, the project team will identify, assess, respond to, and assign personnel to monitor each risk worthy of continued observation.  Individual risk responses will roll up into large scale project contingency plans.  Here we will examine the benefits to establishing, maintaining and improving a project risk management plan and overall enterprise program. </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Identification of Troubled Projects
                        <p>
                            Risk management makes it easier to identify troubled projects.  As mentioned during the introduction, single risk events will be identified, assessed and responses planned. These events aggregate into an overall project risk score.
                            From initial planning, red flags will be raised by virtue of high probability/high impact risks events.  Additionally, the trajectory of the project itself can be assessed by virtue of its risk trajectory.  If project progression results in an accumulation of risk – it’s clear that this is a troubled effort and there won’t be any substitute for decisive action. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fewer Project Surprises
                        <p>
                            A robust risk effort simply reduces surprises.  Of course, there will always be surprises that arise in spite of risk management – the so called unknown-unknowns.  But there does not have to be as many and they don’t have to be as painful.  Risk management forces the project team to be in touch with its event horizons – and prepared to deal with risk events as they occur.   
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Better Quality Data for Decision Making
                        <p>
                            In a nutshell, better quality data means that in order to perform project risk management properly, you’ll require data to analyze your situation.  If you’re going to evaluate schedule risks, you have to have scheduling information.  Hence, you need the capability in place that allows said evaluation.  If you’re going to assess technology risks, you need to have technical information available.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Garbage in equals garbage out.  There is an effort and a skill set required to reap the benefits of risk management.  And as study after study has shown, risk management is something project teams are willing to blow off completely or just pay lip service to. Not having information on hand to be able to assess risks is certainly a fact of life depending on where you are in the project life-cycle.  But now you definitely know you don’t have it.  You know what you need, and that lack of information is itself something needs addressed. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Communication is Elevated
                        <p>
                            Higher quality data is identified as improved in Benefit #3.  So, what do you do with that data?  First, the team uses it for decision making.  Second, and of interest to us here – communication of risk information will demand its own communication channel – a RIC process will provide coverage.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A properly implemented risk program will specify requirements for communicating risk information up and across the organization.  This means that project sponsors and key stakeholders are on top of information as it unfolds – good or bad.   
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        More Accurate Budgets
                        <p>
                            Better data quality is indeed a linchpin of several risk management benefits.  Once risk information is available – it will have a positive impact on budget accuracy. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Further, it will allow a contingency budget to actually be calculated, or at least qualitatively arrived at, rather than simply assigning a standard contingency ‘fee’. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Clear Expectations
                        <p>
                            Everybody wants their technology project to succeed as envisioned.  And everybody is pretty much always disappointed.  If the stakeholders fully understand project risks, then activation of risk contingencies, however difficult, are at least seen as logical and planned if not pleasant. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Team Focus 
                        <p>
                            The project planning process in general and the risk management process in particular will engage and focus team members outside of their respective specialties.  I will say that based on my experience, nothing engages individual team members like being assigned ownership of a risk and responsibility for its monitoring. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Integration into Risk, Issues, and Changes (RIC)
                        <p>
                            Successful project management needs to manage uncertainty but also engage the known problems that emerge during project execution by a combined Risk-Issue-Change process.  Read Change as Project Change Control – the formal process by which the approved project performance monitoring baseline schedules and plans are modified.   
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Project risks represent potential problems and project issues represent known problems.  The short version of RIC is that risk management identifies the potential problems, if and when these become reality, they convert into issues.  Issues are then managed, with possibility that their impact will require project changes. 
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        Proactive vs. Reactive
                        <p>
                            If the project is meeting its obligations as envisioned in a risk management process of the type envisioned in Axelerate’s article entitled “Project Risk Management - Process Landscape,” that team will respond proactively to risk events as they occur.  If the team has not met its risk management obligations, the team will be reactionary, acting in an ad hoc manner to events that have not been identified as risks and will not benefit from any predetermined corrective actions. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Historical Data
                        <p>
                            The accumulation of documented risk information can be used to generate a lessons learned and risk information support database – consisting of both procedural and risk management assist information.  This would be used as a reference in future projects.  Ideally, this will improve not only project level risk management, but project management across the organization.

            <h2>Risk Assessment Matrix</h2>

            <p>
                For most organizations, having a tool to visually represent a risk assessment is paramount to effective operations management. Aside from the purpose of objectively rating risks based on their probability of occurrence and impact levels, a 5×5 risk matrix helps provide an easy-to-follow guide for future risk rating processes whenever a new hazard is identified. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This tool allows Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) professionals conduct thorough risk assessments, having 5 rating levels for each component for a more accurate analysis. With the 5×5 risk matrix explained, compared to other versions like 3×3 and 4×4, the 5×5 version provides a more thorough way of rating risks using a 5-point scale. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Ultimately, the two main advantages of this using this tool are the following: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Helps simplify how various risk levels are represented </li>
                    <li>Reduces the need to conduct time-consuming quantitative analyses </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <img src="src/images/RM-matrix.png" alt="Risk Assessment Matrix" />

            <p>
                Color-coding is crucial for a 5×5 risk assessment matrix template to represent the combination level of probability and impact of the identified risks. That said, high risks must be in red, moderate risks in yellow (amber), and low risks in green. Organizations, EHS professionals, and project managers can then use other closely-related colors, such as orange, light red, and light green, to differentiate the specific risk ratings. 
            </p>

            <h3>Probability</h3>

            <p>Also called likelihood, the Probability (x-axis) pertains to the extent of how likely it is for the risk to occur. The 5 risk rating levels under this component are as follows: </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Rare – unlikely to happen and/or have minor or negligible consequences </li>
                <li>Unlikely – possible to happen and/or to have moderate consequences </li>
                <li>Moderate – likely to happen and/or to have serious consequences </li>
                <li>Likely – almost sure to happen and/or to have major consequences </li>
                <li>Almost certain – sure to happen and/or have major consequences </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Impact</h3>

            <p>Also called severity or consequences, the Impact (y-axis) aims to determine the level of effects that the hazard can cause to workplace health and safety. </p>
            <p>While a 5×5 risk matrix can be tailored to the needs of an organization, the following represent the general terms used to describe the 5 levels to determine the risk’s impact: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Insignificant/Negligible – won’t cause serious injuries or illnesses </li>
                <li>Minor – can cause injuries or illnesses, only to a mild extent </li>
                <li>Significant/Moderate – can cause injuries or illnesses that may require medical attention but limited treatment </li>
                <li>Major – can cause irreversible injuries or illnesses that require constant medical attention </li>
                <li>Severe/Catastrophic – can result in fatality </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Probability x Impact = Risk Level </h4>
            <p>The first step is to assign a numeric value from 1 to 5, 1 being the lowest, for each of the categories under Probability and Impact. Then, use the formula of multiplying the value of the Probability to the value of Impact to determine the Risk Level. </p>
            <p>To better understand how the various levels indicate the Probability and Impact, here’s a guide on the numeric values and their representation as a result of the analysis: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1-4: Acceptable – no further action may be needed and maintaining control measures is encouraged </li>
                <li>5-9: Adequate – may be considered for further analysis </li>
                <li>10-16: Tolerable – must be reviewed in a timely manner to carry out improvement strategies </li>
                <li>17-25: Unacceptable – must implement cease in activities and endorse for immediate action </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Five steps to build a strong contingency plan</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make a list of risks and prioritize them according to likelihood and severity.
                    <p>
                        In the first stage of the contingency planning process, stakeholders brainstorm a list of potential risks the company faces and conduct risk analysis on each one. Team members discuss possible risks, analyze the risk impact of each one and propose courses of action to increase their overall preparedness. You don’t need to create a risk management plan for every threat your company faces, just the ones your decision-makers assess as both highly likely and with a potential impact on normal business processes. 
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Create a business impact analysis (BIA) report 
                    <p>
                        Business impact analysis (BIA) is a crucial step in understanding how the different business functions of an enterprise will respond to unexpected events. One way to do this is to look at how much company revenue is being generated by the business unit at risk. If the BIA indicates that it’s a high percentage, the company will most likely want to prioritize creating a contingency plan for this business risk. 
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Make a plan
                    <p>
                        For each potential threat your company faces that has both a high likelihood of occurring and a high potential impact on business operations, you can follow these three simple steps to create a plan: 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Identify triggers that will set a plan into action: For example, if a hurricane is approaching, when does the storm trigger your course of action? When it’s 50 miles away? 100 miles? Your teams will need clear guidance so they will know when to start executing the actions they’ve been assigned. </li>
                        <li>Design an appropriate response: The threat your organization prepared for has arrived and teams are springing into action. Everyone involved will need clear, accessible instructions, protocols that are easy to follow and a way to communicate with other stakeholders. </li>
                        <li>Delegate responsibility clearly and fairly: Like any other initiative, contingency planning requires effective project management to succeed. One proven way to address this is to create a RACI chart. RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consulted and informed, and it is widely used in crisis management to help teams and individuals delegate responsibility and react to crises in real time. </li>
                    </ul>

                </li>

                <li>
                    Get buy-in from the entire organization—and be realistic about cost 
                    <p>Sometimes it can be hard to justify the importance of putting resources into preparing for something that might never happen. But if the events of these past few years have taught us anything, it’s that having strong contingency plans is invaluable. </p>
                    <p>Think of the supply chain problems and critical shortages wreaked by the pandemic or the chaos to global supply chains brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. When it comes to convincing business leaders of the value of having a strong Plan B in place, it’s important to look at the big picture—not just the cost of the plan but the potential costs incurred if no plan is put in place. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Test and reassess your plans regularly
                    <p>Markets and industries are constantly shifting, so the reality that a contingency plan faces when it is triggered might be very different than the one it was created for. Plans should be tested at least once annually, and new risk assessments performed. </p>
                </li>
