            <h2>Basic description of Waterfall Project Management</h2>
            <p>Waterfall Project Management usually understood to be:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Emphasizes linear progression from the beginning to the end </li>
                <li>Front-loaded methodology: relies on careful planning, detailed documentation and consecutive execution </li>
                <li>Sequential development process that flows like a waterfall through all the phases of the project </li>
                <li>Each phase completed before beginning the next phase </li>
            </ul>

            <p>The phases of the Waterfall model :</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Requirements </li>
                <li>Design </li>
                <li>Implementation </li>
                <li>Testing </li>
                <li>Deployment </li>
                <li>Maintenance </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Why implementing Waterfall Project Management?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Waterfall methodology is a straightforward, well-defined management methodology -> easy to manage </li>
                <li>It is very easy to understand </li>
                <li>Requirements are clearly laid out from the beginning </li>
                <li>Each contributor knows what needs to be done and when </li>
                <li>Helps planning the resources effectively </li>
                <li>Executives and decision makers prefer to see beforehand the required resources </li>
                <li>They also like it that with waterfall method it is easy to show the status of the project (clearly defined milestones) </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>How to use waterfall project management in real life situations? </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Clear Requirements: Invest time upfront in gathering and documenting detailed requirements to minimize changes later in the project lifecycle. </li>
                <li>Thorough Planning: Develop a comprehensive project plan with clear milestones, timelines, and resource allocations. </li>
                <li>Structured Communication: Establish regular communication channels to keep stakeholders informed about project progress and any deviations from the plan. </li>
                <li>Risk Management: Identify potential risks early in the project and develop mitigation strategies to address them. </li>
                <li>Quality Assurance: Incorporate quality assurance activities throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that deliverables meet quality standards. </li>
                <li>Documentation: Maintain thorough documentation of project requirements, designs, code, test cases, and other relevant artifacts. </li>
                <li>While the waterfall approach can be effective for projects with well-defined requirements and low uncertainty, it may not be suitable for highly complex or rapidly evolving projects where flexibility and adaptability are required. In such cases, agile or hybrid project management methodologies may be more appropriate. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Benefits of waterfall project management</h2>
            <p>The waterfall method offers several advantages that make it useful in certain project situations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Clear Structure: The linear sequence of phases allows for a simple and easily understandable structure. This facilitates planning, control, and monitoring of the project.  </li>
                <li>Documentation: Since each phase is fully completed before the next begins, there is comprehensive documentation of the work results. This facilitates communication and understanding within the project.  </li>
                <li>Quality Assurance: The strict separation of phases and the comprehensive testing phase ensure the quality of the work results.  </li>
                <li>Risk Minimization: The strict planning and control of the project phases allow for early identification of risks and issues, which can be addressed in a timely manner. </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="chapter">
            <h2>The disadvantages of Waterfall Project Management</h2>
            <p>Despite the advantages, there are also some disadvantages that can limit the application of the waterfall method:  </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Inflexibility: The linear structure of phases allows for little flexibility in adapting to changes during the project. This can lead to delays or increased costs if requirements need to be changed.  </li>
                <li>Poor Adaptability: In dynamic environments where requirements or technologies change rapidly, the waterfall model can struggle to keep up.  </li>
                <li>Long Development Times: Since each phase must be completed before the next begins, the development of projects in the waterfall method can take longer than with other project management methods.  </li>
                <li>Late Error Detection: Since the testing phase occurs at the end of the project, errors that were overlooked during the development phases may only be discovered late and fixed. This can lead to increased costs and delays. </li>
            </ul>
