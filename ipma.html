          <h2>What is the IPMA certification? </h2>

          <!-- Full width text -->
          <p>IPMA® is a global leader in project management standards and certifications, with its Competence Baseline (IPMA ICB®) 
            as a comprehensive framework for various project management roles. 
            IPMA®’s Four-Level Certification System is unique worldwide and recognised for its quality to elevating professional standards. <br>
            The IPMA 4-L-C System operates with three domains: project, programme and portfolio management; and four levels of competence – Levels A, B, C and D. 
            The IPMA level definitions are constructed against the following core criteria:<br>
            
             <!-- Unordered list -->
            <ul>
              <li>Level A is constructed in terms of the leadership of others in very complex projects (programmes or portfolios) throughout the life cycle (where applicable) at a strategic level.</li>
              <li>Level B is constructed in terms of the leadership of others in projects (programmes or portfolios) and includes complexity throughout the life cycle (where applicable).</li>
              <li>Level C is constructed in terms of the management of others in projects of moderate complexity throughout the life cycle through the application of knowledge/theory across all relevant competences.</li>
              <li>Level D is constructed in terms of knowledge across all relevant competences only.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>IPMA certificate benefits</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Certification is a popular way for project managers, and members of other similar occupations, to signal 
              their proficiency in the practice of their occupation and for hiring managers to filter job applications.  
            </li>
            <li>
              Although certification does not show a strong short-term direct effect on performance, by providing its 
              complementary elements such as professional attitude and networking and its long-term effect such as 
              higher levels of self-efficacy, certification certainly can be a smart move in the career of a project manager
              and can be useful for the whole occupation of project management.  
            </li>
            <li>
              It appears that certification is a good signal of professionalism, which in turn is an indicator of project management
              self-efficacy, which is our best measure of project manager performance. This three-part relationship may seem to be
              a relatively circuitous route from certification to performance, as in fact, it is… And certification’s role in signally 
              is especially important for younger professionals as, when we excluded the years of experience, 
              the effect size of certification on both professionalism and self-efficacy tends to be larger.  
            </li>
            <li>
              Years of experience show a stronger relationship with professionalism than having a certification. 
              Similarly, it shows a stronger relationship with self-efficacy than professionalism. This verifies the notion 
              that mastery experience is primary source of self-efficacy. Interestingly, years of experience is positively related
              to strategic performance and not related to operational performance.  
            </li>
            <li>
              For human resource professionals, hiring manager and organizations, in the absence of other measures available to winnow
               down large numbers of applicants, certification may prove a reasonable criterion for this activity when combined with years
                of PM experience and level of PM training.  
            </li>
            <li>
              For the project management practitioner, since certification is likely to continue to be an essential initial screening 
              tool for project management positions, it remains valuable in increasing their success in the market. This result is not 
              necessarily because obtaining it directly indicates PM proficiency, but mainly because the process of obtaining it, 
              joining a professional association, and increasing PM knowledge are all likely to increase self-confidence and professionalism,
              both of which will likely increase the level of performance. 
            </li>
